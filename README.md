This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (==) and null value handling.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.  Loose equality can lead to unexpected type coercion, making debugging more challenging. The solution emphasizes strict equality (===) and explicit null checks for robust code.
